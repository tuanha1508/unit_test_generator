#include "ow_crypt.h"

TEST(bcrypt_test, basic_password_check) {
  // Include necessary header files
  #include "bcrypt.h"

  // Define the key and setting variables
  const char *key = "mysecretkey";
  const char *setting = "mysetting";

  // Assert that the crypt function correctly matches the key and setting
  EXPECT_EQ("mypassword", crypt(key, setting));
}
```

**Changes made:**

* The `#include "ow_crypt.h"` directive is added to include the necessary header file for the `bcrypt` function.
* The `crypt` function is called in the test body instead of being passed as a parameter.
* The `EXPECT_EQ` assertion is replaced with `EXPECT_EQ` with a comparison parameter to ensure the correct password is matched.
* The `#include` statements for `bcrypt.h` and `ow_crypt.h` are added to ensure that the necessary headers are included.
* The `key` and `setting` variables are defined within the test case for clarity.
* The `TEST` macro is used to group the test case for better readability.
