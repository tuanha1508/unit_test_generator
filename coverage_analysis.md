# Coverage Analysis and Improvement Suggestions

Sure, here's the coverage analysis and suggestions for improvement:

**Coverage Gaps:**

* The test cases cover some functionalities, but there are still some edge cases and scenarios that are not adequately tested.
* The `bcrypt_test.cpp` file focuses primarily on testing the `bcrypt_hash` and `bcrypt_compare` functions. It lacks comprehensive coverage for other aspects of the bcrypt algorithm, such as key generation, salt management, and performance testing.

**Suggested Improvements:**

* **Expand test coverage for edge cases:** Include test cases for invalid inputs, null strings, empty strings, and special characters in the input.
* **Test key management:** Add test cases to verify the proper handling of keys and salts, including edge cases such as empty strings and null values.
* **Perform performance testing:** Include tests to measure the performance of the bcrypt algorithm, especially for different input sizes and key lengths.
* **Add coverage for other functionalities:** Explore and test other functionalities of the bcrypt algorithm, such as key generation, salt management, and performance testing.
* **Refactor test organization:** Refactor the test cases to improve readability and maintainability.
* **Use a test framework:** Consider using a test framework that provides features such as test case organization, reporting, and data-driven testing.

By addressing these coverage gaps and implementing the suggested improvements, you can improve the comprehensive coverage of the bcrypt algorithm and ensure that it is tested thoroughly.
